# Gecoder

## Local setup

- Install ruby: e.g `rbenv install`
- Make sure that you have sqlite installed.
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install sqlite3`
  * Mac: `brew install sqlite`
- Run in your console: `bin/setup`

NOTE: `bin/setup` is a script generated by the rails generator. Basically it does:
- `bundle install`
- `bin/rails db:setup`
- `bin/rails s`

## Deployed by Kamal

You can see the deployed app here: https://geocoder.webcloudpower.com/

## Test docker image by docker-compose

You can test the Dockerfile locally by running the following commands:

- `docker-compose build`
- `docker-compose up`

## Code decisions

- I used the rails auth generator: `bin/rails generate authentication`.
- Use minimized js/css to keep the project a bit simpler (no need for Procfile).
- Use SQLite instead PostgreSQL to keep the project simple.
- Use simple_form gem to show correctly validation errors.
- Use geocoder gem.
- Execute the gecoder asynchrony to not block requests (Yes, I know, this is a
  bit over engineering for a demo project, but in a real world one would have to do
  it in this way)
- Use Kamal for the docker environment because most already comes
  configured by the rails generator. The server is a small virtual machine hosted on
  Hetzner.
- Add a docker-compose file to proof that I know how docker works.
